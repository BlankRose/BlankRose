	<!-- ABOUT ME -->
	<div>
		<p>
			Hai, I'm just another developer like many others, going by the name of Rosie.
			<br><br>
			I have been learning to become a professional software engineer at "42" school since February 2022. My development journey didn't start here, as I've also worked on projects of various sizes for years as a passionate.
			<br><br>
			My journey started with a bit of Scratch and coding on the programmable calculators, along with a little of Lua on the Roblox environment. Now I mainly work with Assembly, C, C++, Python, and Java languages. While I'm not particularly fond of web development, I'm always open to discovering all new technologies in other fields.
			<br><br>
			Most of the projects are defined as private but feel free to check out the few public repositories.
